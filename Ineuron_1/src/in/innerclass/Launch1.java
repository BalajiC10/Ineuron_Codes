		Note:
		The relationship between outer class and inner class is not IS-A relationship and
		it is Has-A relationship.
		It promotes Composition/Aggregation.
		
		Based on the purpose and position of declaration all inner classes are divided into
		4 types.
		They are:
		1. Normal or Regular inner classes.
		2. Method Local inner classes.
		3. Anonymous inner class.
		4. static nested classes.
