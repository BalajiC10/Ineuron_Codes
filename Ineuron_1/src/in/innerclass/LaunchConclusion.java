	 *  Conclusions :
		1. We can declare anything inside any thing with respect to classes and interfaces.
		class A{
			class B{
						}
			}
		class A{
			interface B{//static
							}
			}
		interface A{
			interface B{//public static
							}
			}
		interface A{
			class B{//public static
									}
			}
			
			
			
			2. Nesting interfaces are always public, static whether we are declaring or not.
			3. class which is declared inside interface is always public,static whether we are
			declaring or not
			4. interface declared inside a class is always static,but need not be public.
